Welcome to my open source Hypervisor Orchestration Management Platform, a robust and feature-rich solution designed to enhance the capabilities of network virtualization. This platform is crafted to fill a vital gap in current technology by offering extensive network virtualization features that are not available in existing solutions.

## Project Overview

This platform serves as a management layer for mixed hypervisor hosts, (Initially KVM) enabling users to create, manage, and monitor virtual machines with an emphasis on advanced network configurations. Built from the ground up with network virtualization in mind, it supports sophisticated networking setups such as VXLAN tunnels and integrates seamlessly with technologies like Open vSwitch.

The key motivation behind this project is to provide a tool that supports comprehensive network virtualization in a hypervisor environment, tailored to meet the needs of both small scale labs and larger enterprise setups.

## Features

- **VM Management**: Start, stop, create, and manage virtual machines through a user-friendly interface.
- **Advanced Networking**: Set up and manage complex network configurations, including support for VXLAN and other network overlays.
- **Integrated Storage Solutions**: Manage NFS and other storage options, allowing for shared storage configurations.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Keep track of VM and host performance metrics in real-time.
- **Open Source**: Freely available and open for contributions, aiming to foster a community around improving hypervisor management.

## Motivation

This project was born from a personal need for a hypervisor orchestration tool that emphasizes network virtualization. As someone who is still on their journey of learning to code, I embarked on developing this platform to challenge the status quo and deliver a solution that powers advanced network setups effortlessly. While my coding journey is ongoing, the development of this platform is a testament to the learning process and the potential to contribute meaningfully to the open source community.
